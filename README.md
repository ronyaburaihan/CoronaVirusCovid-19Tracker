### Project Description
We will develop a covid 19 Tracker Android Application. The UI will be like the above screenshot. There are two `Framents` one `Frament`  for World and one `Frament` for the Country list. When we open our App then App will send a request to the web API and show the Global Cases into `World fragment` and all country list sorted by cases will show into `Country Fragment`. We can search the country in `Country Fragment` by country name and view detailed info about `Covid-19` for the selected country by clicking a country item.

### Open Weather API
We will use [Open API for disease-related statistics](https://corona.lmao.ninja/docs/) for collecting `Covid-19` cases information.

### Project Setup
Clone the project and open it using Android Studio.

### Run the project
Sync the `Gradle` and run the project. Install APK on your emulator or real device. Turn on the internet of your testing device.
